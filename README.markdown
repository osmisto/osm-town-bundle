What is this
============

It's a easy way to embedd [OpenStreetMap](http://osm.org) + [OpenStreetBugs](http://openstreetbugs.schokokeks.org/) into any site.
There is a [demo](http://osmisto.github.com/osm-town-bundle) where you can what can be embedded.

For what? A lot of villages and towns have own small site, where residents and guests usually can find own
news and forum for question, discussions, and so on. Some sites have satellite images without labels,
search, pois, but very rare they have own map. Why? The smaller town the fewer benefits for mapping
companies to draw the town. No profit. No map.

This bundle is an attempt to help towns like above and OSM community. I hope we can mutually cooperate, residents
and guest can mark errors, add new info using integrated OpenStreetBugs, and OSM community can import this
into the map. May be even some residents will join to OSM community to draw their town.

How to install
==============

Instuctions and wizard is available on [our site](http://osmisto.github.com/osm-town-bundle)

How to contibute
================

*Best* and *quickest* way to contribute is fork this project on github, make your changes,
and send me link to your branch.

You even can make your site use your branch and be totally independ from me. With git
you can easy merge my changes to your branch and have my updates and your changes at
the same time.

If you don't want to deal with javascript, there is [Issues](http://github.com/osmisto/osm-town-bundle/issues) page
where you can write your wishes.
